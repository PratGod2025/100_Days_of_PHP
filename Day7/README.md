   DAY 7: WEEK

Today I learned about assiociative arrays and their implementation in PHP  :

1. How is associative array different than indexed arrays --> Associative arrays make use of key instead of index in indexed array

2. How to implement key --> by assigning key with values -> more on index.php

3. Functions that I learned yesterday can be implemented as the same way in indexed arrays

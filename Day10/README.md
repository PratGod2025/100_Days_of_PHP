   DAY 10: PROGRESS

Today I learned about Booleans and comparisions in PHP  :

1. Booleans --> In true and false
                         
2. when we echo true then the output will come as 1 and when we echo false, the output will produce nothing 
                                                                     
3. It is because PHP basically initiates 1 and null(nothing) as true and false

4. tested in -> index.php

5. It also works on string based on the first letter of the alphabet
                for example
                if we  echo 'pratyush' > 'ronaldo' -> then the output will come nothing as p< r in alphabetical order

6. Incase of uppercase letter , it is shown less value than a lowercase letter

7. echo 5 == '5'; -> output -> 1 (true statement even tho one is number and another is string)
but
      echo 5 === '5'; -> output -> null ( the triple equal to even takes the data type into consideration)

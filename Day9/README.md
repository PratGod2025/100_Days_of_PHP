   DAY 9 : CHILL

Today I learned about indexed loops and their implementation in PHP  :

1. Loops's types (that I learned) ?--> There are three types of loops in php
                          i> For loop
                         ii> Foreach loop
                         iii> While loop
2. Why is loop used? → To execute an code n number of times
                                                                     
3. How is while loop different from for loop? --> it is pretty similar to for loop except the fact that the value of i is denoted outside and the adding i part is also after the statement

4. How can we add looping system in html , while using php --> in index.php

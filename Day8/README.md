   DAY 8: ARRAY_SAKKYO_FINALLY

Today I learned about multi-dimensional arrays and their implementation in PHP  :

1. How is multi-dimesional array different? --> In Multi-dimesional array , we have the square for the outer array and for the inside array 

2. Indexed array doesnot make much sense, but associative array makes a lot more sense but the big array is still indexed arrays -> in case of multi-dimensional array

3. to remove last position of the array --> $popped = array_pop($variable_name);

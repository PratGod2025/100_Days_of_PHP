    DAY 2: INTRESTING

Today was nothing but the intoduction and installation of PHP
Some key points which I learned are:

1. PHP tag? --> <?php ?>
2. echo --> used to produce output
3. What I did to run the code --> (on index.php of this day)
                                    -> made a folder named tuts inside htdocs
                                    -> added a file named index.php
                                    -> used basic tag ie, <?php 
                                    -> added echo and  gave my message , lastly added a semicolon
                                    -> to run , just made change in localhost/dashboard and made it localhost/tuts
                                    -> It runs great
5. Learned that index file send whats written inside echo and the browser interprets it as HTML
6. Learned how to embedd HTML file in this (index.php) file --> added this in index.php as well

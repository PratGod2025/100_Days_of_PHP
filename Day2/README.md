    DAY 2: INTERESTING

Today was nothing but the intoduction and installation of PHP
Some key points which I learned are:

 1. PHP tag?--> A basic one is  < ? php  ? > (used in both index.php and index1.php)
2. echo --> used to produce output
3. What I did to run the code --> (on index.php & index1.php of this day)
                                    -> made a folder named tuts inside htdocs
                                    -> added a file named index.php
                                    -> used basic tag ie, <?php 
                                    -> added echo and  gave my message , lastly added a semicolon
                                    -> to run , just made change in localhost/dashboard and made it localhost/tuts
                                    -> It runs great
5. Learned that index file send whats written inside echo and the browser interprets it as HTML
6. Learned how to embedd PHP file in html file --> added this in index1.php as well

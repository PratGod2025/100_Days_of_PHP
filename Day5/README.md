    DAY 5: EASY

Today I learned about numbers and their implimentation in PHP  :

1. Number's types ?--> There are basically two number types in php
                          i> int
                         ii> float
2. int --> It contains integer values .
                                       example; $age = 50
                                                                     
3. float --> It contains floating point numbers .
                                        example; $pi = 3.14
5. How do we perform math operations in PHP? --> We perform math operation in PHP by using the help of basic operators
6. If we dont want to use escape character for double quote we can basically use single quote 
                             for eg: 
                             * , / , +, -, **(to denote power)
7. In what rule does PHP work on math ? --> For mathematical operation , it uses BODMAS rule

                      (written in index.php)
8. Some operators that I learned about today --> 
                                               1. Increment & Decrement Operators
                                                 --> ++ & --
                                               2. Shorthand Operator
                                                 --> += is a shorthand operator it is the same as
                                                  $age = $age + 10
                                                      —> for subtraction -= works same as
                                                      $age = $age -10
                                                      —> for multiplication *= works same as
                                                      $age = $age * 10
9. Today Learned about Number function;
                                 about floor( ) → it converts the float number into the nearest integer
                                 about ceil( ) → it converts float number into nearest Upward integer
                                 about pi() -> it gives the value of pie (longer version)

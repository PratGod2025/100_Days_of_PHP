   DAY 6: EXAMS

Today I learned about indexed arrays and their implementation in PHP  :

1. Array's types ?--> There are basically three types of arrays in php
                          i> indexed arrays
                         ii> associative arrays
                         iii>multi-dimensional arrays
2. Indexed arrays --> It is the easiest array to create & they are really common + very simple to set up
                                                                     
3. array in PHP -->  [ ] → indicates an array in PHP → and we put our value inside that
                                             
5. How do we Create an array in PHP? --> $variable_name = ['Pratyush','Ronaldo','Messi'];
                                         $variable_name = array('John','Cena');
6. Why is the array named Indexed array ? --> we can access those values using an index ; hence giving it the name indexed array
                    
7. New method to print value of an array instead of echo --> 
                                              different method to print the value
                                                    it is by using print_r(array_name); → it creates a readable form of the array (also in index.php)
8. How do we determine the position of array --> we learnt about positioning in PHP, positioning in array is same 
9. Today Learned about some functions;
                                array_push(Variable_name, value to be pushed); → pushes the newest value into the last position
                                array_merge(first array, second array); → it merges array
                            
10. how to add new value to an array -—> just put value_name[blank] = new_value

Today I learned about variables and their use , :

1. How to Create a Variable?--> To create a Variable we can use $Variable_name for example $age
2. Rules for variables --> first letter can not be number and special character is not allowed
3. What is a camel case --> A camel case is when the word contains two words ,
                            the first letter of the first word is written in
                            lowercase while the second word's first letter is 
                            written in UPPERCASE
                            for eg: firstName
5. In PHP we can use both single or double quote

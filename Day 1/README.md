DAY 1: SURUWAT

Today was nothing but the intoduction and installation of PHP
Some key points which I learned are:

1. Why PHP? --> Really easy to pick up and run with.
2. Full Form --> Hypertext Preprocessor
3. How to download --> download XAMPP which directly downloads php (it contains)
4. Localhost denotes that the computer is being used as a server
5. XAMPP's files are served from a folder called htdocs
6. Learned to toggle in it and why the localhost/ automatically gets redirected to localhost/dashboard after we delete subdirectory --> mentioned in index.php
